    <h2>A unique challenge: Technology and the Church</h2>
    <p>Our passion is serving and equipping the local church. After spending years volunteering and serving on staff in the local church, we became very familiar with the unique technology challenges in the Church. There were many tools we would use for a variety of the day-to-day tasks but most didn't fit our needs exactly. Tools were difficult to use and even more difficult to train volunteers. We'd sometimes build our own tools to help, but it wasn't sustainable.</p>
    <p>More challenging than simply picking the right tools was having the time to use them. Church staff is spread thin enough as it is, and volunteers need an ongoing investment in time and training to take over these tasks. We found ourselves doing the same things multiple times every week--especially once we started sattelite campuses. Because of the time investment, we'd often have to make the hard decision to avoid technology altogether.</p>
    <h3>"There has to be a better way..."</h3>
    <p>It's with these challenges that the idea for Bethel was born. An easy-to-use an integrated platform that's purpose-built for the needs of the local church. <strong>Bethel exists to provide a single tool</strong> which your staff or volunteers can use to manage your ministry technology. And because Bethel integrates with everything, you can start using Bethel alongside some of your favorite tools and services you're using right now.</p>
    <h3>Work less and accomplish more</h3>
    <p>We focus on automation and simplicity in everything we build. <strong>With automation, you work less and do more.</strong> We believe that you shouldn't have to do many of the routine and repetitive tasks that you're currently doing. <em>Let the platform work for you and you can accomplish more.</em></p>
