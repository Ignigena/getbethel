    <h2>Pay only for what you use; scale as you grow!</h2>
    <p>We don't believe in confusing plans or feature locking. These strategies
      bait you with a low monthly price only to place you in a much higher tier
      once you start growing. Our goal is to be transparent in our pricing and
      affordable for ministries of any size. To this end, you are billed only
      for the features you use.</p>
    <p>Our pricing continues to be under development as sections of the platform
      move through the beta process. We welcome your continued feedback!</p>

    <h2>Bandwidth</h2>
    <p>Bandwidth is the data that gets passed to a viewer when they watch a
      video or listen to an audio file. Every time someone presses play, data is
      passed from our servers to their browsers, which counts as bandwidth.</p>
    <p>10GB of bandwidth is roughly the equivelant of ~10,000 minutes of audio
      or ~1,500 minutes of video. You are billed based on the total amout of
      data used each month. <a href="/contact">Have questions?</a></p>
